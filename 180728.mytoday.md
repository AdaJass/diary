today i saw a film call *Mad Max: Fury Road*, and then i still wasted my time. My job is somehow frastrated, they are lazy and not going to push it on. We talk little, progress little, and i'm lazy too. Mayby i need to make some strict rule for me, these day, i've done very well. i wrote diary almost every day. but this is just a little step to the order life, i need things to be in order, i dont like this way, but just need it, because if all in fuzzy, i will lost my control and play games, see films all day long.

tomorrow, let me thing of it clearly.
